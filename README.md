# Eloquent JavaScript

This repository presents solutions to the excercises in the third edition of Marijn Haverbeke's *Eloquent JavaScript* ([ISBN 978-1-59327-950-9](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B07C96Q217&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_fxZ.EbDN7B1DB)).

## Running Solutions

These solutions were written to be run within the [Node.js](nodejs.org) runtime environment. After installing Node.js and downloading this repository, to run an excercise simply run node with the excercise name as a parameter from the Terminal.  For example:

````bash
$ node chapter01/helloworld.js 
````

## Solutions Provided

The excercise solutions attempt to only use the concepts that have been introduced up to that
point in the book.  For example, chapter one solutions to not use functions since functions
are introduced in chapter two.

### Chapter One - Values, Types, and Operators

* helloworld.js - A bonus since chapter one does not have any exercises. But, we might as well say, "Hello!"

### Chapter Two - Program Structure

* triangle.js - Outputs a triangle to the console
* fizzbuzz.js - Outputs the classic [Fizz buzz game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) and [FizzBuzz programming interview question](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/) for numbers from 1 to 100
* chessboard.js - Outputs an NxN [chessboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessboard) pattern to the console
